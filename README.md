# Solidity Game - DEX Attack

_Inspired by OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com), Dex Level_

Please see [DexTwo](https://github.com/maAPPsDEV/dex-two-attack) for another Dex game.

‚ö†Ô∏èDo not try on mainnet!

## Task

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic [DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange) contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

You will start with 10 tokens of `token1` and 10 of `token2`. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token.

You will be successful in this game if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract, and allow the contract to report a "bad" price of the assets.

**Quick note**

Normally, when you make a swap with an ERC20 token, you have to `approve` the contract to spend your tokens for you. To keep with the syntax of the game, we've just added the `approve` method to the contract itself. So feel free to use `contract.approve(contract.address, <uint amount>)` instead of calling the tokens directly, and it will automatically approve spending the two tokens by the desired amount. Feel free to ignore the `SwappableToken` contract otherwise.

_Hint:_

1. How is the price of the token calculated?
2. How does the `swap` method work?
3. How do you `approve` a transaction of an ERC20?

## What will you learn?

1. ERC20
2. SWAP

## What is the most difficult challenge?

### DEX ü§ë

The idea of this game is that flash loan attacks are rampant in the DeFi world, and having some experience with some of the price issues is going to be a must for up and coming solidity developers.

Basically, the Dex is a really crappy uniswap. It reports a price based on liquidity pools, and a user can use this to flip back and forth and eventually drain the dex of the liquidity pools.
